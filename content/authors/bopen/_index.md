B-Open is an Italian SME specialised in algorithm design and software development for Earth Observation, image processing and data-/work-flow management. Our team combines a research-oriented attitude – with a majority of the resources being post-doc or PhD – with a strong industrial background. We have extensive experience working for international organisations and national institutions in Europe and in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as for large Italian companies and multinationals.
