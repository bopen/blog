I am the CTO and technical lead of B-Open (Rome, Italy), a software consulting company I co-founded in 2004, whose specialities are algorithm design and software development for Earth Observation, image processing and data-/work-flow management, leveraging the scientific Python ecosystem. I have extensive experience working for international organisations and national institutions in Europe and in the Mediterranean Area, as well as for large Italian companies and multinationals. I am also a co-maintainer of a few Open Source Software projects: xarray, cfgrib, elevation and xarray-sentinel, and I made significant contributions to GDAL in the past. I am a Ph.D in Physics.
